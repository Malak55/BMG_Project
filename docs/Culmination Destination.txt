Work Breakdown
We tried to take advantage of our strengths and preferences.  
Matt Schiereck - The Project Manager (he made the mistake of creating the repo). Matt also developed the front-end (HTML/CSS files).
Rod Skoglund - Developed the back-end Javascript files to manage the page including input error handling that utilizes Modal Dialog Boxes to communicate with the user.
Danny Zamora - Developed API interfaces to get the info we need and provide it to the Javascript code for the display.

Challenges
Developing this app uncovered several challenges
A template that fit our needs
Adding forms, buttons, radio buttons and checkboxes
Switching from Alerts to using modals to pop up messages for the user
Selecting good APIs from a wide selection of available choices
Learning how to use GIT in a collaborative environment

Future Enhancements
Features that should be added to improve the users experience.
Calculating overall cost
Providing a printable itinerary
Add travel guide and blog for user reviews
