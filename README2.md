# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience? Individuals interesting in traveling and planning their itinerary. 
  2. What is the problem that the product will address? To show traveling individuals everything that they can accomplish in a trip.
  3. What is the primary goal of the product? One stop shop for travel planning events, locations, etc.
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
1. I want to plan out my trip with one website.
2. I want to be able to plan out my vacation in advance and see what events will be going on.
* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
